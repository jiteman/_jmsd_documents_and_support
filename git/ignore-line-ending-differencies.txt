Global approach

	Configure Git line endings handling on Linux or OS X:

		git config --global core.autocrlf input

	Configure Git line endings handling on Windows:

		git config --global core.autocrlf true



I had the same problem on the Mac after cloning a repository. It would assume all files had been changed.

After running git config --global core.autocrlf input, it was still marking all files as changed. After looking for a fix I came across .gitattributes file in the home directory which had the following.

* text=auto

I commented it out and any other cloned repositories from now on were working fine.
